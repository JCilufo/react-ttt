# React TTT

Clone it into a directory that's not already a repo. `cd` into the new repo. `npm i` it. `npm run dev` it`. Optionally, try `npm t`to see the testing âœ…. Just remember that you would have to run`npm run dev`and`npm t` in separate terminal instances......

I downloaded the React extension for Chrome. I think it's pretty cool being able to see each individual components update in real time and I didn't have to
go digging through a bunch of divs to try and find the components. I have encountered no challenges with it thus far. I access it by just opening Chrome DevTools
and clicking on the components tab. It allows me to just click around and select different squares or the entire app and see it all update in real time!
